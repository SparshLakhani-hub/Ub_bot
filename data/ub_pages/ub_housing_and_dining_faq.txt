# Housing and Dining FAQ – University at Buffalo

University at Buffalo offers a variety of on-campus housing options, including traditional residence halls, suite-style living, and apartment communities. Many first-year students choose to live on campus to be close to classes, dining options, and campus activities.

Meal plans typically provide access to dining centers, on-campus restaurants, and grab‑and‑go locations, with different plan levels to match students’ schedules and budgets. Housing and dining contracts often run for the full academic year, and cancellation policies may apply.

Students should always confirm current housing deadlines, deposit requirements, and meal plan details directly with UB Campus Living and Dining Services, as availability, pricing, and policies can change.
